This is the repository for the team *ASD: Morning 1*
Hallo

Start IntelliJ
Open
Choose Project "note" to open
Click Maven (right side of the IDE)
Note - Lifecycle - install (doubleclick)
If error occurs ->  sudo apt update
                    sudo apt install npm
                    sudo npm install npm@latest -g

After install go to Plugins -> spring-boot -> 
RIGHTCLICK spring-boot:run -> 4th entry (Blue M symbol - forgot name)
In the name field change to "RunNote" and press apply

Now u can press the green run-button in the IDE
When the application is running open http://localhost:8080/

When u change something in the code u have to press "install" again in the maven directory!
